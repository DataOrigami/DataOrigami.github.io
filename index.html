        <p> Senators of Canada enjoy a tenure-like position: guaranteed job security, high income and authority over legislation. Here we investigate the lifetimes of Senators seats, and see if we can piece together any details. Before hacking, a colleague or myself will give a small demo 
        on survival analysis, a useful tool for this dataset. </p>

        <h2>Data</h2>

        <p>We have data from all 705 Senators, including the date their were appointed on, whom appointed them, there final date in office (if observed) and some other variables. All data has been scrapped without consent from Wikipedia and parliament's data source.</p>

        <h3>Some important facts:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Senators originally held their seats for life; however, under the British North America Act, 1965 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1965), members, save for those appointed prior to the change, may not sit in the Senate after reaching the age of 75.

            <li>A senator's seat automatically becomes vacant if he or she fails to attend the Senate for two consecutive parliamentary sessions. Furthermore, senators lose their seats if they are found guilty of treason, an indictable offence, or any "infamous crime"; are declared bankrupt or insolvent; or cease to be qualified.

            <li>The base annual salary of each senator, as of 2010, is $132,300 CAD; members may receive additional salaries in right of other offices they hold.

            <li> Individuals must be both citizens of Canada and at least thirty years of age to be eligible for appointment to the Senate. Senators must also maintain residency in the provinces or territories for which they are appointed.
          </ul>

        <p><b>Interested in transportation?</b> I know University students can have a hard time getting around, so if there is enough interest, we can sponser future transportation to and from the universities to the meetings. If you are interested in this, please come to the meeting let me know. </p>

        <h2 id="mixology" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Mixology: Data-driven drinks for our first meeting</h2>
        <p>It's our first meeting, so I think we should start with something unique. Every proper club needs a proper drink.</p>

        <p><blockquote> <b>Can we datamine a unique club drink using a large dataset of cocktail drinks?</b> </blockquote> </p>

        <p>Yes, probably.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p><b>Determine the ingredients:</b> (and perhaps the directions to make the cocktail, too) This may require an objective function. Using the database to weed out bad combinations is a win too! Ideally the drink should have some flair to it.</p>

        <p><b>Create a name for the cocktail:</b> (this should be data determined too) Naively, gather all names of cocktails, split on whitespace, and randomly pick. Better: considering the ingredients we have chosen, look for a pair or triplet of existing cocktails that can be "summed up" to produce our cocktail. This is like a regression task. Using Google Trends to find "hot names", i.e. "One VMA Miley" would be something hilarious. </p>
        <p><b>Look for interesting relationships in the dataset:</b> <i>orange juice => vodka</i>? Some algos that might help: association rules, network analysis...
          
        <p><b>Create a cool postcard-sized graphic about our cocktail:</b> (with recipe) We'll use this to create actual postcards to promote our club: "Dear P.M. Harper, we've noticed you could use a drink...". "Dear Ottawa Citizen, we have provided for you a result you might finding interesting-- the url is at ...." </p>
        
        <p><b>Can we light it on fire?</b> Why not?</p>

        <p><b>Actually drink it.</b> Can we get a local drinking establishment to serve it? Maybe exclusively to our members/meetings?  </p>
